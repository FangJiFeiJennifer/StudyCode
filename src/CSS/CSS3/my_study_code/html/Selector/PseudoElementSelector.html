    Today, my dad is the best dad I could ask for.He’s a loving husband to my mom (always making her laugh),
    he’s been to every one of my soccer games since I was 5 (I’m 17 now), and he provides for our family as a construction foreman.
    This morning when I was searching through my dad’s toolbox for a pliers, I found a dirty folded up paper at the bottom.
    It was an old journal entry in my dad’s handwriting dated exactly one month before the day I was born.
